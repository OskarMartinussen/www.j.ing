#WWW.J.ing


WWW.J.ing is a WJing tool that enables the user to manipulate the structure of any website using specific keys on their keyboard. Allowing the user to create web based visuals to all music.
Each key has a corresponding tag on the website. Once pressed the tag will enlarge, change colour, change position, change z index etc all randomly. When finger is lifted up from key the tag will return to its normal self. There are also three colour profiles to choose from.
